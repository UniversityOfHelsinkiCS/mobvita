## Reading test flow

### Cycles

- 1 set = 5 questions, 1 cycle = 4 sets

- For a new user who hasn't started any tests, we start them on cycle 1 automatically.

- After the user completes cycle 1, and they click "restart test" in the statistics view, we give them the option to choose the cycle out of all available cycles, but the default value of the select is the next cycle in order (1, 2,...). No default value is shown if the cycle that was just completed is the last cycle in the list of available cycles.

### Dialogs

- After each set we show a "Moving on to the next set" dialog.

- Halfway through a cycle, i.e. after the second set, we show the first feedback questionnaire. If the user didn't receive any feedback in the first half of the test, the questionnaire is not shown.

- A second feedback questionnaire is shown after the last question is answered. This questionnaire is not shown if the user didn't receive any feedback in the second half of the test.
